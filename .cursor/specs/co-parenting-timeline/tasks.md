## Migration Strategy
This implementation plan builds incrementally on the existing codebase:
1. **Phase 1 (Tasks 1-6)**: Enhance backend foundation and data models
2. **Phase 2 (Tasks 7-12)**: Upgrade frontend components and add new features  
3. **Phase 3 (Tasks 13-18)**: Add advanced features, testing, and polish

Each task is designed to work with the existing Laravel Breeze + Inertia.js + React setup while progressively adding the missing functionality identified in the requirements and design analysis.
