# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on optimizing git CLI command handling to improve development workflow efficiency by reducing wait times and providing better feedback during git operations. The goal is to implement asynchronous git command processing with real-time status updates and intelligent command batching.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want git commands to execute asynchronously with progress indicators, so that I don't have to wait for long-running operations to complete before continuing other work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a git command is executed THEN the system SHALL display a progress indicator immediately
2. WHEN a git command is running THEN the system SHALL allow other operations to continue in parallel
3. WHEN a git command completes THEN the system SHALL display the result without blocking the UI
4. WHEN a git command fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages with suggested actions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want intelligent git command batching, so that multiple related git operations can be optimized and executed efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple git commands are queued THEN the system SHALL analyze if they can be batched together
2. WHEN git commands can be combined THEN the system SHALL execute them as a single optimized operation
3. WHEN git commands conflict THEN the system SHALL execute them sequentially with appropriate warnings
4. WHEN batched commands complete THEN the system SHALL provide consolidated feedback

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want real-time git status updates, so that I can see the progress of long-running operations like large commits or pushes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a git operation starts THEN the system SHALL show estimated completion time if available
2. WHEN a git operation is in progress THEN the system SHALL display current progress percentage or status
3. WHEN a git operation involves network activity THEN the system SHALL show transfer progress
4. WHEN a git operation completes THEN the system SHALL show summary statistics (files changed, time taken, etc.)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want git command caching and optimization, so that frequently used git operations execute faster.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN git status is requested THEN the system SHALL cache results for a configurable time period
2. WHEN git log is requested THEN the system SHALL implement incremental loading for large histories
3. WHEN git diff is requested THEN the system SHALL cache and reuse results for unchanged files
4. WHEN cached data becomes stale THEN the system SHALL refresh it automatically in the background

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want configurable git command timeouts and retry logic, so that I can handle network issues and large repositories gracefully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a git command exceeds timeout THEN the system SHALL offer options to cancel, retry, or extend timeout
2. WHEN a git command fails due to network issues THEN the system SHALL automatically retry with exponential backoff
3. WHEN a git command fails repeatedly THEN the system SHALL suggest alternative approaches or troubleshooting steps
4. WHEN git operations are configured THEN the system SHALL allow customization of timeout and retry settings
