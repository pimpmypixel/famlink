## Technical Debt & Considerations

### Database Migration Strategy
- Current: SQLite for development
- Target: PostgreSQL for production
- Migration path: Export/import data during deployment

### File Storage Strategy
- Development: Local file system
- Production: AWS S3 or similar cloud storage
- Migration: Implement storage abstraction layer

### Authentication Enhancement
- Current: Laravel Breeze (session-based)
- Future: MitID integration for Danish users
- GDPR compliance requirements

### Performance Considerations
- Timeline items may grow significantly
- Implement pagination and lazy loading
- Consider caching strategies for frequently accessed data

### Security Requirements
- NIS2 compliance for Danish government integration
- Secure file handling and storage
- Audit logging for legal compliance
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
